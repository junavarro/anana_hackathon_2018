This library isn't just a wrapper around MQTT.js for angular >= 2.
It uses observables and takes care of subscription handling and message routing.

If you have any issues using this library, please visit it's [homepage](https://sclausen.github.io/ngx-mqtt/) and look for similar issues in the issue tracker before you file a bug.

## **ngx-mqtt >= 6 is only compatible with angular >= 6**
